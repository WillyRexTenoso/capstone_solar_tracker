# capstone_solar_tracker:
Arduino code for a dual-axis solar tracker using photodiodes and TB6600 stepper drivers. Continuously reads light levels and adjusts panel orientation with two motors (azimuth + elevation) based on real-time sensor differences. Designed for Arduino Uno. Below is a flow chart that shows the logic on a high level.
